## Technical Stack Details

### Smart Contract Layer
- **Framework**: Anchor 0.31.1
- **Language**: Rust
- **Blockchain**: Solana
- **Development Network**: Localnet â†’ Devnet
- **Testing**: Mocha/TypeScript

### Frontend Layer
- **Framework**: React 18+
- **State Management**: React Context API or Redux
- **Wallet Integration**: @solana/wallet-adapter
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS or MaterialUI
- **Build Tool**: Vite or Create React App

### Development Tools

- **Linting**: ESLint/Prettier
- **Deployment**: Solana CLI

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **Yield Integration**: Complex and time-consuming
   - Mitigation: Implement stub functions first, add real integration if time permits
   
2. **Dispute Resolution Complexity**: Legal/UX challenges
   - Mitigation: Focus on core functionality first, enhance with evidence handling later
   
3. **Time Constraints**: 5-6 days is tight for full implementation
   - Mitigation: Prioritize core features, have simplified versions ready

### Priority Features (Must Have)
1. Basic commitment contract creation
2. Deposit functionality
3. Successful withdrawal
4. Basic dispute reporting

### Nice-to-Have Features (If Time Permits)
1. Yield integration
2. Advanced evidence handling
3. Arbitration panel
4. Detailed analytics
5. Mobile app

## Success Metrics
- Contract deploys successfully to devnet
- All primary user flows work (create, deposit, withdraw)
- Dispute reporting functions
- Clean, functional UI
- Comprehensive documentation
- Demo video showing complete flow
