- [ ] Handle fund distribution based on penalty rules

## Phase 5: Withdrawal Functionality

### Task 10: Successful Withdrawal
- [ ] Implement `withdraw_success` instruction
- [ ] Add authorization checks
  - [ ] Verify requester is participant

  - [ ] Verify contract is `Completed`
- [ ] Validate withdrawal amount
  - [ ] Verify requester entitlement
- [ ] Process token transfer

### Task 11: Penalty Withdrawal
- [ ] Implement `withdraw_penalty` instruction
- [ ] Add authorization checks based on penalty rules
- [ ] Add state validation
  - [ ] Verify contract is `BreachValidated`
- [ ] Process token transfer according to penalty rules

## Phase 6: Advanced Features

### Task 12: Yield Integration (Optional)

- [ ] Implement yield deposit function (stub)
- [ ] Implement yield withdrawal function (stub)
- [ ] Add yield tracking to commitment account

### Task 13: Emergency Withdrawal (Optional)

## Code Quality Standards

### Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for instruction names
- Use PascalCase for struct and enum names
- Use descriptive variable names
- Follow Anchor naming conventions

### Documentation
- Add doc comments for all public functions
- Document complex business logic
- Include example usage where helpful
- Maintain up-to-date error documentation

### Error Handling
- Provide specific error messages
- Use appropriate error categories
- Handle all edge cases
- Return meaningful errors to clients

### Testing Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Test both happy and sad paths
- Include boundary condition tests
- Mock external dependencies where possible

This task breakdown should provide a clear roadmap for implementing the HeartLock smart contract with proper validation and testing at each stage.
